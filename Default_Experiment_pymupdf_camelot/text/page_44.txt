2024–2029 National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program 
BOEM 
OCS Oil & Gas Leasing Program Development Process 
1-15 
September 2023 
As shown in Figure 1-8, the National OCS Program development process starts with the broadest 
RFI and consideration of all 26 OCS planning areas and can be narrowed throughout the National 
OCS Program development and associated lease sale processes.  Once a defined area is included 
during the National OCS Program development process, it becomes known as a program area.  
Program areas are therefore the portions of the original OCS planning areas that remain under 
leasing consideration during the National OCS Program development process.  For example, the 
Cook Inlet Program Area in the 2017–2022 Proposed Program included only the northern portion 
of the larger Cook Inlet Planning Area that was originally considered for leasing in the 2017–2022 
DPP.  The initial Draft Proposal in this instance included 25 of 26 planning areas across all OCS 
Regions, which have since been narrowed to all or portions of four planning areas (three in the 
GOM and one offshore Alaska).
