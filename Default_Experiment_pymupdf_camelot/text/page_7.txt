Final Proposal on OCS Lease Sales for 2024–2029 
 
needs are met. BOEM continues to review 
research on potential net-zero emissions 
pathways and implications for the National 
OCS Program and has reviewed available 
data to refine its analysis in this PFP. 
Importantly, the Secretary may conduct new 
environmental and technical analyses on an 
ongoing basis to help inform lease sale 
decisions. These additional decision points 
allow the Secretary to consider new 
information about national energy needs, 
policy direction, or other factors when 
choosing whether to hold any lease sale.  
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-
169) was enacted on August 16, 2022, shortly 
after the Proposed Program was published. 
The IRA offers funding, programs, and 
incentives designed to accelerate the 
transition to a clean energy economy and 
drive significant deployment of new clean 
energy resources. The Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) forecasts for the effects 
of certain IRA provisions have been 
incorporated into the forecasts used in the 
analysis presented herein and considered by 
the Secretary in making this Final Proposal.  
Final Proposal: 2024–2029 Lease Sale 
Schedule 
After carefully considering public input and the 
OCS Lands Act Section 18(a)(2) factors, this 
Final Proposal includes three potential OCS 
oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico 
(GOM) Program Area, which includes the 
Western GOM Planning Area and the portions 
of the Central and Eastern GOM planning 
areas not currently under Presidential 
withdrawal (see Section 4.6), where more 
than 99% of current OCS production occurs. 
Notwithstanding this Final Proposal, the 
Secretary retains the discretion at the lease 
sale stage to determine whether, when, and 
under what terms, a lease sale should be held 
and the precise acreage to be offered.  
An option for a potential lease sale in the 
northern portion of the Cook Inlet Planning 
Area was identified in the Second Proposal 
and analyzed as part of the PFP and Final 
Programmatic EIS. Based on consideration of 
Section 18 requirements and factors, a Cook 
Inlet lease sale is not included in this Final 
Proposal.   
Table 1 reflects the schedule of potential 
lease sales for 2024–2029. Figure 2 depicts 
the program area remaining in this National 
OCS Program.
