Assuming that hydrocarbon resources are discovered and successfully delineated, a production 
facility could be installed at the site.  The number of wells to be served by a single facility varies 
according to the type of production facility used, the prospect site, and the drilling and production 
strategy deployed.  Oil and gas resources are brought to market via a system of pipelines and 
processing facilities or through production into a floating system.  
Exploration plans and development and production plans are subject to focused, site-specific 
environmental analyses under NEPA and other environmental statutes, as well as the 
requirement for an operator to certify consistency of the proposed activities with the enforceable 
policies of a state’s CZM program, as appropriate.  
For more information about the exploration and development process, see BOEM’s web pages on 
the status of oil and gas plans for the Alaska Region (https://www.boem.gov/akplans), GOM 
Region (https://www.boem.gov/Status-of-Gulf-of-Mexico-Plans/), and Pacific Region 
(https://www.boem.gov/Pacific-Lease-Management/).  For more information about BOEM’s oil 
and gas resource evaluation program, see the web page: https://www.boem.gov/Resource-
