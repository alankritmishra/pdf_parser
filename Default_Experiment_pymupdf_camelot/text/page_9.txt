live bottom habitat in the block and undertake 
measures to protect the live bottom features. 
These measures could include relocation of 
operations, shunting of fluids and cuttings, 
and monitoring to assess the impact of the 
activity on the live bottom areas. 
Applying these stipulations at the National 
OCS Program development stage is 
consistent with current practice and continues 
the effective protection of these biologically 
sensitive areas, should they be offered in the 
three potential lease sales scheduled under 
this Final Proposal. 
Secretarial Consideration of the OCS 
Lands Act Section 18 Requirements and 
Factors 
This Final Proposal narrowed the schedule of 
potential lease sales from the Second 
Proposal’s maximum of 11 potential sales in 
two program areas to three potential sales in 
one program area as best to meet national 
energy needs after careful consideration and 
balancing of all Section 18 factors, including 
the potential for environmental damage, 
discovery of oil and gas, and adverse impact 
on the coastal zone.  
One way the Secretary considers economic, 
social, and environmental values in managing 
non-renewable resources on the OCS is 
through estimates of the domestic benefits to 
society from the potential oil and natural gas 
production that could result from the proposed 
lease sales and the domestic environmental 
and social costs associated with anticipated 
exploration, development, and production 
activities. BOEM also considers similar 
benefits and costs of substitute energy 
sources that would be consumed in the 
absence of new OCS leasing. BOEM’s 
analysis finds that there are potential net 
benefits of a National OCS Program with 
lease sales in the GOM Program Area for 
2024–2029. Based on current and projected
