2024–2029 National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program 
September 2023 
 
8 
Final Proposal on OCS Lease Sales for 2024–2029 
 
is no current crude oil or natural gas 
production from the 15 currently active Cook 
Inlet OCS leases.   
Given Alaska’s relatively small population and 
lack of industrialization, a large percentage of 
the goods and services needed for oil and gas 
development in Cook Inlet would likely be 
imported from other parts of the country and 
world markets. The need to import these 
goods and services could result in increased 
shipping traffic, and the lack of onshore 
infrastructure required for OCS oil and gas 
operations would necessitate new 
construction along the coast. The Final 
Programmatic EIS concludes, since the area 
is relatively undeveloped, that potentially 
significant adverse impacts are likely from any 
new leasing in the Cook Inlet Program Area, 
particularly for cultural practices, subsistence 
uses, recreation, and tourism. Selection of the 
No Sale Option for Cook Inlet means that no 
increased environmental risks from coastal 
construction or OCS exploration, 
development, and production activities from 
new leases would occur in this area.   
The three potential lease sales in this Final 
Proposal are included by the Secretary 
because they have the greatest resource 
potential and net benefits with the least 
potentially significant impacts and costs to 
society. The Secretary believes that this 
proposed schedule will meet national energy 
needs for the next 5 years under existing laws 
and policies, while also recognizing that 
progress along a net-zero emissions pathway 
will be a consideration when evaluating the 
appropriateness of future sales.
