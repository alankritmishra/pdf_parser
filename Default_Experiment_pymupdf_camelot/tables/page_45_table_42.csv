USDOI,2024–2029 National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program,BOEM
,Section 18(a)(2) of the OCS Lands Act lists eight factors that the Secretary must consider when,
,"determining the size, timing, and location of oil and gas leases among the different OCS areas",
,(see Chapter 2).  The analysis contained in the DPP examined and compared all 26 OCS planning,
,"areas regarding the Section 18(a)(2) factors for consideration, as well as the balancing mandated",
,by Section 18(a)(3).  The National OCS Program development process is typically a winnowing,
,"process, and only those program areas and Subarea Options that the Secretary decides are",
,appropriate to carry forward for further analysis are included in the next analytical document.,
,The Second Proposal narrowed the scope of this National OCS Program to the area of the GOM,
,"not under withdrawal (i.e., the Western GOM Planning Area, most of the Central GOM Planning",
,"Area, and a small portion of the Eastern GOM Planning Area); and to the northern portion of the",
Cook Inlet Planning Area.,,
BOEM has decided to prepare a Programmatic EIS in accordance with the National,,
,Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq.) and its implementing regulations as,
,a vehicle for conducting and disclosing the environmental analyses for the National OCS Program.,
,BOEM’s decision to prepare the Programmatic EIS is discretionary because the U.S. Court of,
,Appeals for the District of Columbia has ruled that the approval of a National OCS Program does,
,"not constitute an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources, and that, in the context",
,"of BOEM’s multiple stage leasing program, the obligation to fully comply with NEPA does not",
,"mature until the lease sale stage (Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of the Interior,",
,"563 F.3d 466 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Center for Sustainable Economy v. Jewell, 779 F.3d 588",
,(D.C. Cir. 2015)).  Figure 1-7 shows the key steps in preparing a new National OCS Program under,
,Section 18 of the OCS Lands Act and the Programmatic EIS under Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA.,
,The program areas included in the Secretary’s Second Proposal are further analyzed in this PFP,
,document and in the 2024–2029 National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program Final Programmatic,
Environmental Impact Statement (BOEM 2023a).  Chapter 3 provides additional detail on what is,,
,included in the PFP analyses.  The NEPA analysis includes an evaluation of the potential,
,environmental and related socioeconomic impacts associated with the proposed lease sale,
,"schedule, and how those impacts could vary depending on the areas or regions that are included",
,"in the National OCS Program.  The NEPA process is introduced in the discussion of Factor (H),",
,"relevant environmental and predictive information for different areas of the OCS, in Section 2.3; a",
more detailed description is also contained in the Programmatic EIS.,,
,The Programmatic EIS identifies sensitive subareas that could warrant exclusion from this,
,National OCS Program due to potential environmental impacts from oil and gas lease exploration,
,and development.  The Programmatic EIS addresses the effects of lease sales under the new,
,"National OCS Program, which includes those lease sale effects that could be experienced beyond",
"BOEM program area boundaries, such as potential impacts on migratory animals.",,
