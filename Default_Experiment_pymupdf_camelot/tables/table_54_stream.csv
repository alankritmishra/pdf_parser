"As shown in Figure 1-8, the National OCS Program development process starts with the broadest",,
RFI and consideration of all 26 OCS planning areas and can be narrowed throughout the National,,
OCS Program development and associated lease sale processes.  Once a defined area is included,,
"during the National OCS Program development process, it becomes known as a program area.",,
,Program areas are therefore the portions of the original OCS planning areas that remain under,
,"leasing consideration during the National OCS Program development process.  For example, the",
,Cook Inlet Program Area in the 2017–2022 Proposed Program included only the northern portion,
of the larger Cook Inlet Planning Area that was originally considered for leasing in the 2017–2022,,
DPP.  The initial Draft Proposal in this instance included 25 of 26 planning areas across all OCS,,
"Regions, which have since been narrowed to all or portions of four planning areas (three in the",,
GOM and one offshore Alaska).,,
