USDOI,2024–2029 National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program,BOEM
,The Biden-Harris Administration outlined several goals for a clean energy economy and set,
,national emissions targets.  A key priority of the Biden-Harris Administration is to achieve,
,carbon-free electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions for the U.S. economy by 2050.  The,
,Administration also set a target to achieve a 50–52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide,
net greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution by 2030.,,
,"In making decisions on the National OCS Program, the Secretary considers how future OCS crude",
,oil and natural gas leasing factors into national energy needs and energy-related goals.  This,
,section considers the broad interpretation of domestic energy needs recognized in the language,
,"of the OCS Lands Act and applicable case law, such as Center for Sustainable Economy v. Jewell,",
,"779 F.3d 588, 607 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (CSE).  As such, BOEM’s assessment of the Nation’s energy",
,needs for purposes of Section 18 extends beyond “meeting current demand for domestic,
,consumption.”  This section considers energy needs under both the current national energy,
,landscape and the possibility of an energy market that is significantly transformed by,
transitioning to a clean energy economy.,,
