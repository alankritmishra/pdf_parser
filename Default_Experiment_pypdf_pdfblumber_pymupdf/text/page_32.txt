USDOI 2024–2029 National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program BOEM 
OCS Oil & Gas Leasing Program Development Process 1-3 September 2023 
The Biden-Harris Administration outlined several goals for a clean energy economy and set 
national emissions targets.  A key priority of the Biden-Harris Administration is to achieve 
carbon-free electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions for the U.S. economy by 2050.  The 
Administration also set a target to achieve a 50–52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide 
net greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution by 2030.   
In making decisions on the National OCS Program, the Secretary considers how future OCS crude 
oil and natural gas leasing factors into national energy needs and energy-related goals.  This 
section considers the broad interpretation of domestic energy needs recognized in the language 
of the OCS Lands Act and applicable case law, such as Center for Sustainable Economy v. Jewell, 
779 F.3d 588, 607 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (CSE).  As such, BOEM’s assessment of the Nation’s energy 
needs for purposes of Section 18 extends beyond “meeting current demand for domestic 
consumption.”  This section considers energy needs under both the current national energy 
landscape and the possibility of an energy market that is significantly transformed by 
transitioning to a clean energy economy.  
1.2.1 Crude Oil and Natural Gas:  Contribution to and Consu mption within 
the U.S. Economy  
Americans have spent more than $1 trillion a year on energy since 2005 (EIA 2023g) as illustrated 
in Figure 1-2.  In 2020, approximately 63% of those expenditures was attributable to natural gas 
and petroleum expenditures (EIA 2021g).  Although the United States consumes more than just 
crude oil and natural gas to fulfill its energy demand, these fuels contribute to powering the U.S. 
economy and are expected to continue to do so in the future―as can be seen through the lens of 
the Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) 2023 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) reference case. 
This section considers projections based on the EIA’s 202 3 AEO reference case,4 where 
projections rest solely on laws and regulations that are currently in place and actively enforced.  
Using policy-neutral projections allows decisionmakers to assess the potential impact of a specific 
decision against the policy baseline, which incorporates currently enforced policy, technological 
and legal conditions, trends, and constraints into the future.  Importantly, the EIA modeled 
numerous provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into the 2023 AEO, including, (1) the 
extension and modification of clean energy tax credits, (2) tax credits for zero-emission vehicles, 
(3) new production tax credit for existing nuclear power plants, and (4) a separate clean fuel 
production tax credit  (EIA 2023f).  However, given its complexity and uncertainty over select 
implementation details, not every IRA provision could be modeled in the 2023 AEO release.5  
 
4 The definition for the reference case can be found in the 2023 AEO narrative at the website. 
5 Specific information regarding the IRA provisions modeled in the EIA’s 2023 AEO can be found in Table 1 of the EIA’s 
2023 AEO Appendix.
