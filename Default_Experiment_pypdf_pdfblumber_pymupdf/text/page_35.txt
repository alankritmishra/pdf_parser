As described, the AEO highlights the projections’ uncertainty and the various assumptions that 
could impact the results.  Figure 1-4 shows EIA’s forecasted uncertainty cone around future 
petroleum and other liquids consumption and production.  For demand, assumptions including 
low economic growth and low costs of zero-cost carbon technologies result in the largest decline 
in petroleum and other liquids use through 2050.

Figure 1-5 shows EIA’s projections of total energy consumption by source between 2022 and 
2050.  Although the petroleum and natural gas share of overall energy consumption shrinks from 
2022 to 2050, both still represent a substantial share of consumption.  The renewable energy 
share of energy consumption greatly increases by 2050, while the shares of nuclear and coal 
significantly shrink.  Section 6.2.1 provides more information on crude oil and natural gas 
consumption. 
As a result of the energy consumption and energy mix changes, the 2023 AEO projects lower 
carb
on dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 in its reference case (see Figure 1-6).  The increase in 
renewable energy technologies, increased electrification, and more efficient equipment leads to 
emissions reductions; however, this reduction is offset by the EIA’s forecast of longer-term 
growth in transportation and industrial activity (EIA 2023b). 
For the various side cases, the AEO projects that energy-relat ed CO2 emissions could range from 
25% to 38% below 2005 levels by 2030.  The AEO shows that long-term assumptions for 
economic growth and the cost of zero-carbon generation technology are the most significant 
drivers in emissions reductions.
