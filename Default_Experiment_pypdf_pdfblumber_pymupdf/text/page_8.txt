Programmatic Mitigation of 
Topographic Features and Pinnacle 
Trends 
Under this Final Proposal, the Secretary 
requires that all leases issued under this 
National OCS Program employ mitigation 
measures to protect sensitive seafloor 
features. Figure 3 shows the location of these 
sensiti
ve areas.  
BOEM and i
ts predecessor agencies have 
required avoidance of sensitive bottom 
habitats in the GOM for decades. A 
topographic features stipulation was first 
applied in 1974 and has been used 
consistently since April 1996 in all lease sales 
where the sale area included known 
topographic features. Similarly, the Live 
Bottom (Pinnacle Trend) stipulation was first 
applied in May 1983 and has been used for all 
applicable sales since 1990.  In the Record of 
Decision approving the 2017–2022 Program, 
the Secretary adopted the Topographic 
Features and Live Bottom (Pinnacle Trend) 
lease stipulations as required mitigation for 
any leases issued in applicable GOM blocks.  
These stipulations are designed to avoid or 
minimiz
e harm from seafloor-disturbing 
activities to these sensitive and unique 
underwater features. The existing 
Topographic Features stipulation covers 
38 topographic banks, which excludes all 
bottom-disturbing activity in the most sensitive 
biological areas defined via bathymetric 
contours (generally 85 meters [279 feet]). A 
progression of buffer distances around all 
banks (e.g., 1 mile [1.6 kilometers], 3 miles 
[4.8 kilometers], and 4 miles [7.4 kilometers]) 
establishes different levels of protection. 
The Live Bottom (Pinnacle Trend) stipulation 
currently applies to 74 blocks in the 
northeastern portion of the Central GOM 
Planning Area. Lessees with a block subject 
to this stipulation would be required to assess
