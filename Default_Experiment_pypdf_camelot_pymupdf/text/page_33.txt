While AEO projections for 2050 are meant to capture “ranges and trends” and “robust insights 
rather than precise numbers” (EIA 2023c), the projections could change depending on various 
factors, including alternative energy market pathways adopted for addressing climate change.  In 
addition to the reference case, the 2023 AEO models 12 side cases that cover different 
assumptions.  These assumptions include high and low ranges for: crude oil and natural gas 
supply, crude oil price, economic growth, zero-carbon technology cost, and a few combination 
cases.  One goal of side-case comparisons to the reference case is to demonstrate a “cone of 
uncertainty” within the forecasts (EIA 2023c).  This analysis focuses on the reference case but 
includes some insights from the side cases.   
Figure 1-3 shows energy consum ption by sector and source in the U.S. for 2022 and the 2023 
AEO’s forecast of energy consumption by sector and source in 2050 from the reference case.  Of 
note is the predominance of petroleum and other liquids in the transportation sector.  Recent 
changes in energy markets have affected consumption of different fuels, but petroleum remains 
the dominant fuel for transportation.  While advancements in electric vehicle technology, 
alternative fuels, and fuel efficiency improvements will likely reduce petroleum’s share of 
transportation energy demand, petroleum is still needed to meet a large majority of future total 
transportation energy demand under AEO’s baseline scenario.
