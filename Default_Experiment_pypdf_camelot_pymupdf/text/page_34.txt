Note: The “other” category represents biofuels heat and co-products for the industrial sector; hydrogen, natural gas used 
to liquefy gas for export, and pipeline and distribution fuel natural gas for the transportation sector; and electricity 
imports and non-biogenic municipal waste for the electric power sector.

In 2022, petroleum and other liquids accounted for approximately 95% of transportation fuel.  The 
2050 AEO reference case projection shows that petroleum and other liquids will power 90% of 
the transportation energy market with the overall domestic consumption of petroleum and other 
liquids falling 3.6% between 2022 and 2050.  The predominance of petroleum and other liquids for 
transportation is consistent across all the AEO side cases as well.   
Despite the decline in petroleum and other liquids in the transportation sector, the increase in the 
use of petroleum and other liquids in the industrial sector nearly offsets the transportation sector 
reductions in AEO’s reference case in 2050.  
Shifts in fuel consumption sources are most apparent in the electricity sector, where increases in 
renewables offset declines in coal and natural gas.  Domestically, the share of electricity 
generation from renewable sources is projected to more than double from 21.5% in 2022 to 59.5% 
in 2050.  The 2023 AEO reference case also projects an increase in electricity demand through 
2050 of roughly 15% (EIA 2023c).
