The \ndevelopment of the National OCS Program \nincludes a Request for Information, followed \nby three analytical phases. The three phases \nused to develop a new National OCS Program \ninclude: issuance of the (1) Draft Proposed \nProgram (DPP), including the Draft Proposal; \n(2) Proposed Program, including the Second\nProposal; and (3) Proposed Final Program\n(PFP), including this Final Proposal. This\nNational OCS Program development process\nbegins with the broadest consideration of\nareas available for leasing (i.e., all 26 OCS\nplanning areas), and the areas under\nconsideration can be narrowed at each stage\nthroughout that development process. See\nFigure 1 for a depiction of the National OCS\nProgram d\nevelopment process.\nIn January 2018, BOEM published the first of \nthe three analytical phases, the DPP, which \nincluded a proposed schedule of 47 lease \nsales in all four OCS regions and 25 of the \n26 planning areas. The subsequent Proposed \nProgram, published in July 2022, had a \nproposed schedule of up to 11 lease sales in \ntwo program areas. Following the publication \nof the DPP, BOEM received more than \n2 million comments, and following the \npublication of the Proposed Program and the \ncompanion Draft Programmatic Environmental \nImpact Statement (Programmatic EIS), BOEM \nreceived approximately 760,000 comments. \nDiverse stakeholders and partners \ncommented, including governors, Federal \nagencies, state agencies, local agencies, \nenergy and non-energy industries, Tribal \ngovernments, non-governmental \norganizations and advocacy groups, and the \npublic (see Chapte\nr 11 and Appendix A for \nmore i\nnformation).  \nThe PFP, includ\ning this Final Proposal, and \nthe companion Final Programmatic EIS \npresent the analysis of the Proposed Program \nschedule of lease sales, referred to as the \nSecond Proposal, and incorporate input \nreceived during the public comment period. \nAlthough analysis under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act is not required at the \nNational OCS Program development stage, \nBOEM chose to prepare a Programmatic EIS \nto aid in the evaluation of certain \nenvironmental, sociocultural, and \nsocioeconomic impacts associated with the \nSecond Proposal.  \nThe PFP and Final Pro grammatic EIS \nanalyses present a comprehensive picture of \nthe environmental, cultural, economic, and \nhydrocarbon resource considerations to aid \nthe Secretary in determining the size, timing, \nand location of potential lease sales evaluated \nin this PFP for 2024\u20132029.

Figure 3 shows the location of these \nsensiti\nve areas.  \nBOEM and i\nts predecessor agencies have \nrequired avoidance of sensitive bottom \nhabitats in the GOM for decades. A \ntopographic features stipulation was first \napplied in 1974 and has been used \nconsistently since April 1996 in all lease sales \nwhere the sale area included known \ntopographic features. Similarly, the Live \nBottom (Pinnacle Trend) stipulation was first \napplied in May 1983 and has been used for all \napplicable sales since 1990.  In the Record of \nDecision approving the 2017\u20132022 Program, \nthe Secretary adopted the Topographic \nFeatures and Live Bottom (Pinnacle Trend) \nlease stipulations as required mitigation for \nany leases issued in applicable GOM blocks.  \nThese stipulations are designed to avoid or \nminimiz\ne harm from seafloor-disturbing \nactivities to these sensitive and unique \nunderwater features. The existing \nTopographic Features stipulation covers \n38 topographic banks, which excludes all \nbottom-disturbing activity in the most sensitive \nbiological areas defined via bathymetric \ncontours (generally 85 meters [279 feet]). A \nprogression of buffer distances around all \nbanks (e.g., 1 mile [1.6 kilometers], 3 miles \n[4.8 kilometers], and 4 miles [7.4 kilometers]) \nestablishes different levels of protection. \nThe Live Bottom (Pinnacle Trend) stipulation \ncurrently applies to 74 blocks in the \nnortheastern portion of the Central GOM \nPlanning Area.

Absent OCS lease sales in the 5 years \nfollowin\ng National OCS Program approval, \nOCS oil and gas production would continue \nonly from existing leases. Production from \nexisting OCS leases currently constitutes 15% \nof domestic oil production and 2% of domestic \nnatural gas production (BSEE 2022, EIA \n2022a, 2022b, 2022c). Based on the number \nof active, non-producing leases and BOEM\u2019s \nrecent production forecast for the GOM (see \nSection 5.2) \u2015which quantifies future \ncontribut\nions from existing proved reserves, \ndiscovered resources not already developed, \nand undiscovered resources \u2015 the Secretary \ndetermined that three potential lease sales in \nthe GOM Program Area provide adequate \naccess to the region\u2019s oil and gas resources to \nmeet national energy needs. \nConsideration of national energy needs \nincludes t\nhe current energy landscape as well \nas the possibility of an energy market \nsignificantly transformed by transitioning to a \nnet-zero emissions economy. The long-term \nnature of OCS oil and gas development, such \nthat production on a lease may not begin for a \ndecade or more after lease issuance and can \ncontinue for decades, makes consideration of \nnet-zero pathways relevant to the Secretary\u2019s \ndeterminations on how the National OCS \nProgram best meets the Nation\u2019s energy \nneeds. The net-zero emissions pathways \nintroduced in Section 1.2\n illustrate the \npotential f\nor less dependence on oil and gas \nas the electricity sector de-carbonizes. \nChapter 5 summarizes analysis  from the \nEconomic Analysis Methodology Paper \n(BOEM 2023) on t he impacts of potential net-\nzero emissions pathways on BOEM\u2019s analysis \nof OCS leasing. For example, BOEM\u2019s \nanalysis shows that, in a future where the U.S. \nmakes significant progress towards its net-\nzero emissions goals, a reduction in reliance \non OCS oil and gas production would occur. \nThis reduction will result in greater energy \nsubstitution from renewable sources and a \ngreater reduction in consumption than is \ncurrently projected using baseline data from \nthe EIA. In these alternative scenarios, BOEM \nwould expect less reliance on imports and \ndomestic onshore oil and gas production in \nthe absence of OCS production. \nAs the amount of energy produced f rom \nrenewable sources and the consumption of \nsuch energy increases, the continued ability to \nissue leases for offshore renewable energy is \nanother important consideration as the \nSecretary seeks to balance national energy \nneeds with the impacts of climate change and \nother potential for environmental damage and \nimpacts to coastal zones.  \nSection 50265(b)(2) of the IRA requires \nBOE\nM to offer at least 60 million OCS acres \nfor oil and gas leasing within the 12 months \nprior to issuing an offshore wind lease. The \nthree lease sales in this Final Proposal have \nthe potential to meet national energy needs \nalong projected energy consumption and net-\nzero emissions pathways, while providing \nother national benefits in terms of balance of \npayments of trade, energy security, \ntechnology advancement, lower  \ncarbon-intensity crude oil and natural gas \nproduction, public revenues, and employment \n(see Sectio\nn 1.2.3). \nThe Secretary has considered the ei ght \nSection 18(a)(2) factors and concluded that \nthree potential lease sales in the GOM \nProgram Area reflects a proper balance of the \npotential for environmental damage, discovery \nof oil and natural gas, and adverse impact on ",

The Gulf Coast region has \nthe most throughput of crude oil and \npetroleum products because it has the most \nproduction, refining capacity, and an extensive \nimport and export infrastructure. The region \nhas the greatest ability to use its resource \npotential to supply the Nation\u2019s energy needs. \nThe GOM Program Area is adjacent to robust \nrefining and natural gas processing capacity, \nand Gulf Coast refineries have access to \ndomestically produced oil from the OCS, state \nwaters, and onshore, as well as imported oil, \nand can blend oil of various grades and \nqualities to obtain the best prices given their \nspecific equipment and facilities. \nWhile the GOM region is sensitive to the \nenviron\nmental impacts of development, there \nare many commercial, recreational, and \nsubsistence uses within the area, including \nnon-energy marine minerals and the potential \ndevelopment of renewable energy. In recent \ndecades, Gulf Coast states have received \nmost of the developmental benefits and borne \nmost of the environmental risks associated \nwith developing OCS resources because most \nOCS oil and gas activities occur in the GOM. \nChapte\nr 9 discusses the equitable sharing of \nbenefits\n and risks of implementing the Second \nProposal across regions, recognizing that \nsignificant infrastructure for oil and gas \ndevelopment already exists in and near the \nGOM.  Therefore, lower levels of new \ndevelopment would be required, potentially \navoiding or reducing environmental risks \nassociated with new coastal development. In \naddition, the current, extensive onshore \ninfrastructure contributes to local and state \neconomies and helps fund government \nservices. Continued Federal oil and gas \nleasing in the GOM is supported by the \ngovernors from the Gulf Coast states of \nAlabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  \nUnder a No S\nale Option, the consequences \nfor the GOM region could include losses of \nemployment and business opportunities for \ncommunities that have been providing goods, \nservices, and labor to support OCS activities. \nHowever, the ultimate effects of the No Sale \nOption depend on the prevailing economic \nenvironment, including factors such as energy \nprices, resource discoveries, and the evolution \nof the economy to support new economic and \nemployment opportunities.  \nThere is flexibility at the lease sale stage to \nadopt a targeted approach such that the GOM \nProgram Area could be narrowed by \nremoving, among other options, acreage that \nhas not recently had extensive bidding, \nexploration, or development activity, or which \ndoes not contain actively pursued geologic \nplays or areas of recent seismic acquisition \nand processing. Such flexibility could also \nallow for the removal of biologically sensitive \nareas and areas of potential conflict with other \nuses and users of the marine environment. \nThis targeted approach would only offer lease \nsales in areas with high resource potential \nwhile appropriately weighing environmental \nprotection, other uses of the ocean and \nseabed, and other considerations, consistent \nwith the policy of the OCS Lands Act to make \nOCS oil and gas resources available for \nexpeditious and orderly development while \nconsidering safeguards for the human, \nmarine, and coastal environment.   \nThe No Sale Option was selected for the Cook \nInlet Pr\nogram Area due to limited expressed \ninterest of potential oil and gas producers, the \nlack of development on existing OCS leases, \nand the potential for higher environmental \nrisks associated with new leasing in relatively \nundeveloped areas as described in the Final \nProgrammatic EIS.  The Cook Inlet Program \nArea has recently seen low levels of industry \ninterest. No specific indications of interest \nwere received from oil and gas companies in \nresponse to the Call for Information and \nNominations for Lease Sale 258; this sale was \nultimately held in 2022 as directed by the IRA \nand resulted in one lease on one tract.

The need to import these \ngoods and services could result in increased \nshipping traffic, and the lack of onshore \ninfrastructure required for OCS oil and gas \noperations would necessitate new \nconstruction along the coast. The Final \nProgrammatic EIS concludes, since the area \nis relatively undeveloped, that potentially \nsignificant adverse impacts are likely from any \nnew leasing in the Cook Inlet Program Area, \nparticularly for cultural practices, subsistence \nuses, recreation, and tourism. Selection of the \nNo Sale Option for Cook Inlet means that no \nincreased environmental risks from coastal \nconstruction or OCS exploration, \ndevelopment, and production activities from \nnew leases would occur in this area.   \nThe three potential lease sales in this Final \nProposal are included by the Secretary \nbecause they have the greatest resource \npotential and net benefits with the least \npotentially significant impacts and costs to \nsociety. The Secretary believes that this \nproposed schedule will meet national energy \nneeds for the next 5 years under existing laws \nand policies, while also recognizing that \nprogress along a net-zero emissions pathway \nwill be a consideration when evaluating the \nappropriateness of future sales.\nReferences \nBOEM. 2023.

The OCS \nLands Act sets forth procedures to administer leasing, exploration, development, and \nproduction of those resources.  Section 18 of the OCS Lands Act (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344) calls for the \npreparation of a nationwide OCS oil and gas leasing program that sets forth a 5-year schedule of \npotential lease sales designed to best meet the Nation\u2019s energy needs for the 5 years following \napproval of a new National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program (generally referred to as the \nNational OCS Program).  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), within the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior (USDOI), is responsible for implementing the requirements of the \nOCS Lands Act related to preparing the leasing program.   \nBOEM has nearly completed the process of preparing the 2024\u20132029 National OCS Program \nto follow the 2017\u20132022 National OCS Program.  Throughout this document, the 2024\u20132029 \nNational OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program title is sometimes shortened to  \n\u201c2024\u20132029 Program\u201d and past National OCS Programs referred to as a variation of this short-\nhand (e.g., 2017\u20132022 Program).  The 2024\u20132029 Program will be the tenth National OCS \nProgram to be approved.  This document consists of the following parts: \nPart I:  Final Proposal on the Size, Timing, and Location of OCS Lease Sales \nThis part\n of the document presents the Secretary\u2019s Final Proposal, the third of three stages of \nthe National OCS Program development process.  The Final Proposal results from the \nSecretary\u2019s consideration of the analysis contained in Part II of this document, as well as the \nFinal Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final Programmatic EIS), which is being \npublished concurrently with this document.  Part I contains the potential lease sale schedule and \nprogram areas to be included in this National OCS Program.  This part also summarizes the \nrationale behind the Final Proposal. \nPart II:  Analysis of the Secretary\u2019s Second Proposal \nChapters 1 through 4 describe the framework for developing a new National OCS Program.  \nThese chapters discuss the substantive and procedural requirements to prepare a National OCS \nProgram under Section 18 of the OCS Lands Act and describe BOEM\u2019s approach to meeting \nthose requirements.  This includes a discussion of the Section 18 requirements and factors \nrelating to OCS oil and natural gas resources and the environmental, economic, and social \nconsiderations that Section 18 requires be considered when deciding where and when to \n",

Those criteria, and the way in which they have been considered in preparing this  \n2024\u20132029 Proposed Final Program (PFP) (also referred to as the 2024\u20132029 Program), are \nsummarized in Chapter 2. \nThe OCS is defined in the OCS Lands Act (43 U.S.C. \u00a71331) and consists of all submerged lands, \nsubsoil, and seabed lying seaward and outside of the lands beneath navigable waters.  In most \ncases, the OCS extends from 3 nautical miles (nm) from the coastline to the seaward extent of \nthe jurisdiction of the United States (U.S.), which is at least 200 nm, and beyond in some cases, \nfrom the coastline (see Figure 1-1).2  \nSection 18 of the OCS Lands Act requires that the proposed schedule of lease sales be based \nupon a comparative analysis of the oil and gas-bearing regions of the OCS.  For administrative \nand planning purposes, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has established four \nOCS Regions composed of 26 planning areas.  The four OCS Regions are Alaska, Pacific, Gulf of \nMexico (GOM), and Atlantic.  Administratively, the Pacific Region includes the State of Hawaii, \nbut for the purpose of developing this National OCS Program, the Pacific Region is only \ncomposed of the four planning areas off the U.S. West Coast.   \n2 State jurisdictions for Texas and Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast extend 9 nm from the coastal baseline.  Louisiana\u2019s jurisdiction \nextends to 3 imperial miles, reflecting boundaries at the time these states joined the U.S.  In 1983, President Reagan \nproclaimed the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the U.S. over submerged lands and seas adjacent to the U.S. within \nthe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), as it was understood to be under international law.  The United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) subsequently addressed the continental shelf in Article 76, providing that \nit extends to at least 200 nm and beyond in some cases.  The U.S. is not a party to UNCLOS but recognizes the rules in \nArticle 76 as customary international law, which the U.S. follows.   \n",

A key priority of the Biden-Harris Administration is to achieve \ncarbon-free electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions for the U.S. economy by 2050.  The \nAdministration also set a target to achieve a 50\u201352% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide \nnet greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution by 2030.   \nIn making decisions on the National OCS Program, the Secretary considers how future OCS crude \noil and natural gas leasing factors into national energy needs and energy-related goals.  This \nsection considers the broad interpretation of domestic energy needs recognized in the language \nof the OCS Lands Act and applicable case law, such as Center for Sustainable Economy v. Jewell, \n779 F.3d 588, 607 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (CSE).  As such, BOEM\u2019s assessment of the Nation\u2019s energy \nneeds for purposes of Section 18 extends beyond \u201cmeeting current demand for domestic \nconsumption.\u201d  This section considers energy needs under both the current national energy \nlandscape and the possibility of an energy market that is significantly transformed by \ntransitioning to a clean energy economy.  \n1.2.1 Crude Oil and Natural Gas:  Contribution to and Consu mption within \nthe U.S. Economy  \nAmericans have spent more than $1 trillion a year on energy since 2005 (EIA 2023g) as illustrated \nin Figure 1-2.  In 2020, approximately 63% of those expenditures was attributable to natural gas \nand petroleum expenditures (EIA 2021g).  Although the United States consumes more than just \ncrude oil and natural gas to fulfill its energy demand, these fuels contribute to powering the U.S. \neconomy and are expected to continue to do so in the future\u2015as can be seen through the lens of \nthe Energy Information Agency\u2019s (EIA) 2023 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) reference case. \nThis section considers projections based on the EIA\u2019s 202 3 AEO reference case,4 where \nprojections rest solely on laws and regulations that are currently in place and actively enforced.  \nUsing policy-neutral projections allows decisionmakers to assess the potential impact of a specific \ndecision against the policy baseline, which incorporates currently enforced policy, technological \nand legal conditions, trends, and constraints into the future.  Importantly, the EIA modeled \nnumerous provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into the 2023 AEO, including, (1) the \nextension and modification of clean energy tax credits, (2) tax credits for zero-emission vehicles, \n(3) new production tax credit for existing nuclear power plants, and (4) a separate clean fuel \nproduction tax credit  (EIA 2023f).  However, given its complexity and uncertainty over select \nimplementation details, not every IRA provision could be modeled in the 2023 AEO release.5  \n \n4 The definition for the reference case can be found in the 2023 AEO narrative at the website. \n5 Specific information regarding the IRA provisions modeled in the EIA\u2019s 2023 AEO can be found in Table 1 of the EIA\u2019s \n2023 AEO Appendix. \n",

However, the AEO also notes that policies can and often do change, which would result in \ndifferent future energy patterns.  In viewing policy change within a net-zero framework, the Final \nEconomic Analysis Methodology (EAM) paper (BOEM 2023b) prov ides additional information on \nnet-zero pathways including Princeton University\u2019s Net-Zero America study (Larson et al. 2021).   \nWhile there are many f actors that play a role in addressing climate impacts and numerous \npathways to meet net-zero emissions goals, the Princeton study outlines five domestic pathways \nthat share multiple features but differ in several important respects.  The key differences are the \nassumptions made about the degree of electrification, supply constraints for various energy \nsources, and use of carbon sequestration. \nOne example of the differences is the role for nuclear power under some, but not all, of the \nPrinceton pathways.  However, the most critical common feature shared by the Princeton study\u2019s \nfive pathways is the varying role and importance of clean electricity.  Other common features \nbetween the pathways include the following: \n Coal use is essentially eliminated by 2030 in all pathways with no new capacity added. \n Biomass6 expands rapidly after 2030 and is widely used by 2050. \n Electricity and hydrogen (H2) use increase across all pathways,7 with H2 from \nbiomass8 being a key and relatively low-carbon fuel using carbon capture technology. \n The deployment of agricultural and/or forestry land sink enhancement measures.9 \nAl\nl net-zero pathways face challenges in achieving domestic net-zero emissions by 2050.  Of \nparticular importance, and independent of any National OCS Program decision, is the immediate \nneed to mobilize capital and ensure political and public commitment to effectively (1) deploy \nmature technologies quickly, (2) build key infrastructure, and (3) improve and establish less \nmature technologies.  For example, three of the five Princeton pathways require an aggressive \nconversion to electric vehicles by 2050.  This contrasts with EIA\u2019s reference case, where the U.S. \nonly has 15% of light duty transportation electrified by 2050.   \n \n6 As defined by the EIA, biomass is \u201corganic non-fossil material of biological origin constituting a renewable energy \nsource.\u201d \n7 H2 under these pathways can be made by reforming natural gas (without or with CO2 capture), gasifying biomass \n(with CO2 capture), or electrolyzing water.  Each pathway takes a different approach or combination of approaches. \n8 Biomass plays a particularly critical role because it removes CO2 from the atmosphere as it grows and can be \nconverted to H2 while capturing and permanently sequestering its carbon. \n9 \u201cLand sinks\u201d are areas where carbon is removed from the air and permanently stored in soil or trees to offset positive \nGHG emissions from elsewhere in the economy.  This helps to reduce the cost of emissions reductions. \n",

Specifically, the Secretary may, when proposing and finalizing the National OCS \nProgram, account for the fact that there are both direct and indirect benefits to issuing leases \nduring the next National OCS Program, which could affect national energy needs.  The direct \nbenefits of OCS leasing include ensuring an adequate energy supply and the corresponding \neffects on crude oil, refined products, and natural gas prices.   \nAnother associated benefit of the National OCS Program is the continued ability for BOEM to \nissue offshore wind leases.  In addition, Section 50265(b)(2) of the IRA requires BOEM to offer at \nleast 60 million OCS acres for oil and gas leasing within the 12 months prior to issuing an offshore \nwind lease.  This requirement is effective until August 16, 2032. \nOffshore wind leases will help meet the clean energy needs of the Nation.  Additional indirect \nbenefits, which are discussed in further detail below, include improved balance of payments, \nenergy security, technology advancement, the comparatively low GHG-intensity of OCS \nproduction compared to onshore and most foreign production, domestic employment, and the \nadditional public revenues generated by leasing. \n1.2.3.1 Balance of Payments and Trade \nThe country\u2019s transition away from being a net importer of energy continues to improve the \nbalance of trade and provide positive contributions to gross domestic product (GDP).  In contrast \nto the $945.3 billion trade deficit (BEA 2022) for all U.S. goods and services in 2022, petroleum \nconsisting of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas liquids, had a trade surplus of \n$14.1 billion (BEA 2023).  That surplus represents a dramatic shift in the energy trade balance for \npetroleum products, which showed a deficit of approximately $189 billion in 2014, one year before \nthe crude oil export ban was lifted (USCB 2021). \nA positive trade balance in crude oil, refined petroleum products, and liquified natural gas (LNG) \nalso contributes to increased GDP because the value of exports counts toward domestic product \nwhile the value of imports is excluded from GDP.  As a significant source of crude petroleum (and \nto a lesser extent natural gas), OCS production contributes to this positive balance of trade in \ncrude oil, refined petroleum products, and LNG.  Long-term projections by the EIA following \ncurrent laws and policies show the U.S. as a net energy exporter through 2050 (EIA 2023g).   \n  ",

Maximizing domestic crude \noil and natural gas production can contribute to both U.S. and worldwide energy security by \nproviding adequate supply that can help limit the impact of foreign supply shocks and reduce \nfuture price volatility (Krauss 2018). \nCrude oil and LNG are global commodities sold in a competitive world market; a reduction in \nsupply (or an increase in demand) in one part of the world causes shifts in global prices.  The \ncontinuing possibility of high and volatile prices raises important energy policy issues about \nsupply options and their economic as well as environmental effects.  As the U.S. progresses in \ntransitioning to a new energy economy to meet climate goals, it will rely less on crude oil and \nnatural gas and be less susceptible to global crude oil and natural gas supply shocks.  However, \nduring the transition to new energy sources, the U.S. will continue to rely on crude oil and natural \ngas supply to ensure continued energy security. \n1.2.3.3 Technology \nNew technologies employed by the crude oil and natural gas industry are, in large part, \nresponsible for making the U.S. the world\u2019s top producer of crude oil and natural gas.  Many of \nthese technological advances include offshore technology developed in the GOM that have \ngreatly expanded offshore resources accessible for production, especially in deeper water depths.  \nIn addition, the OCS crude oil and natural gas industry has reduced deepwater (200 meters or \ngreater) project costs through greater equipment standardization. \nHigher quality geological and geophysical (G&G) data\u2015achieved through state-of-the-art \nacquisition methods and processing\u2014has aided in the identification of prospects and effective \nwell placement, which improves the probability for commercial discoveries.  Consequently, \ncompanies are able to drill fewer wells per discovery in the best prospects (Raval 2018).  \nAdvanced composite materials and materials engineering have improved OCS structures and \nmoorings to better withstand the operating environment.  These and other technologies \ndeveloped for crude oil and natural gas operations have contributed (and continue to contribute) \nto U.S. leadership in the crude oil and natural gas industries, while supporting U.S. economic \ngrowth and helping to meet domestic and global energy needs. \n1.2.3.4 Low GHG Intensity of OCS Production \nTechnological advancements and a strong regulatory framework have contributed to reducing the \ncarbon profile of the OCS.  Based on current research, data suggest that deepwater GOM \nproduction has among the lowest carbon intensities of crude oil projects.  The deepwater GOM\u2019s \nlow GHG intensity is due to several factors including restrictions on venting and flaring of OCS ",

The available data suggests that deepwater GOM production has low \nGHG-intensity profiles relative to oil produced elsewhere (Cooney et al. 2016).  The data sources \nalso indicate that heavy crude oil production (such as in Canada or Venezuela) has the highest \nGHG intensity by far, followed by conventional onshore crude oil production. \nA subsequent estimate of GHG intensities for worldwide crude oil and natural gas production was \nprepared by Rystad Energy, an energy research company.  A comparative analysis of BOEM\u2019s \nYear 2017 Emissions Inventory Study and Rystad Energy\u2019s data found that, in 2017, 83% of GOM \ndeepwater production was below Rystad Energy\u2019s estimated total U.S. average upstream GHG \nintensity of 12 kilograms per barrel of oil equivalent (kg/BOE).  Additionally, 94% of GOM \ndeepwater production was less than Rystad Energy\u2019s estimated global average upstream GHG \nintensity of 18 kg/BOE (Rystad Energy 2020).  BOEM analysis calculated that the GHG intensity \nfor crude oil produced in the deepwater GOM, where BOEM expects almost all future OCS \nproduction to occur, was approximately 11.5 kg/BOE in 2017.  In addition, production from the \nGOM was estimated to have the lowest GHG intensity within the domestic crude oil \nconsumption mix (Cooney et al. 2016). \nIn general, the highest GHG-intensity projects are those that produce heavy crude oil, flare or \nvent substantial amounts of natural gas, are late in their production lifecycle, or use inefficient \ntechnologies.  Crude oil projects tend to have higher GHG intensities than natural gas projects, \nalthough this seems to be primarily driven by the extent of natural gas flaring and venting \n(Masnadi et al. 2018). \n1.2.3.5 Employment and Public Revenues \nThe domestic energy industry is an important component of the U.S. economy through its \ncontribution to GDP, employment, and public revenues.  Production of domestic crude oil \nprovides employment at higher-than-average wages to industry employees, but also supports \ndomestic jobs in other industries that supply goods and services for exploration, development, \nproduction, and domestic transportation of crude oil and natural gas. \nWhile the crude oil, natural gas, and supporting services industries create higher-paying jobs, the \namount of those jobs supported annually has declined since reaching a recent high in 2014.10  This \ndecline is due in part to lower crude oil and natural gas prices and industry adaptations to cut \n \n10 This is evidenced in employment trends reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Series IDs: CEU1021100001, for \nAll Employees, Oil and Gas Extraction, and CEU1021311201, Support Activities for Oil and Gas Activities. \n",

The impact of the OCS crude oil and natural gas industry on GDP \nand employment is discussed in Chapter\n 9 in the con\ntext of the geographical distribution of \ndevelopmental benefits and environmental risk, which also describes the revenues available to \nthe local, state, and Federal governments.  In general, OCS leasing and production provide the \nfollowing public revenues: \n funds to the U.S. Treasury \n funding for the Historic Preservation Fund \n funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) \n OCS Lands Act Section 8(g) and Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) \nrevenue sharing payments to states11 \n Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) funding up to $1.3 billion per year from Fiscal \nYear (FY) 2021 through FY 2025 \n1.2.4 OCS Role in Meeting National Energy  Needs \nAlthough leasing decisions made in this National OCS Program are not guaranteed to result in \nnew production for several years, the development and production would eventually contribute \nto meeting national energy needs.  This increased national energy supply would also provide \nother national benefits in terms of the balance of payments and trade, energy security, \ntechnology advancement, lower carbon-intensity crude oil and natural gas production, public \nrevenues, and employment.  Absent future lease sales, OCS production is expected to continue to \noccur from existing leases.  Section 5.2.8 discusses the potential for crude oil and natural gas \ndevelopment from existing leases.  Without future lease sales or additional opportunities for \nproject expansions, tie-back fields, or new developments, OCS production would ultimately \ndecline.  \nBOEM\u2019s responsibility to develop a National OCS Program requires consideration of the size, \ntiming\n, and location of lease sales over a 5-year period, with the understanding that leasing could \nhave impacts for decades.  While activities associated with new leases will generate years of \neconomic opportunities, crude oil and natural gas production from new leases will likely not \ncommence until approximately 5 years (for shallow water production) to 10 years (for deep water \nproduction) following a lease award.   \nThe Secretary may also re-evaluate national energy needs when deciding whether to hold any \nindividual lease sales included in the approved National OCS Program.  These additional decision \n11 Section 8(g) of the OCS Lands Act provides for the Federal government to share with any coastal state adjacent to \nOCS oil and gas activity 27% of revenues earned from OCS leases within 3 nm seaward of the state\u2019s submerged lands \nboundary.  The shared revenues are referred to as \u201c8(g) revenues.\u201d  In 2006, Congress passed the GOMESA, which \nmandates that the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama receive a portion of revenues from new oil and \nnatural gas development in Federal waters adjacent to these states.  \n",

Section 18 requires the Secretary \nto prepare an oil and gas leasing program that consists of a 5-year schedule of proposed lease \nsales that the Secretary determines best meets national energy needs (see Section 1.3.1).   \nFor any specific lease sale to be held, it must be included in an approved National OCS Program.  \nA lease sale cannot be added later to an existing National OCS Program without an act of \nCongress.  Whether a lease sale is held depends on sale-specific analysis (see Section 1.3.2).  \nFollowing a lease sale, BOEM performs a review and either accepts or rejects bids within 90 days. \nOnce granted, an oil and gas lease conveys the exclusive right to explore, develop, and produce oil \nand/o\nr gas for a specific initial period (for a minimum of 5 and maximum of 10 years) from a \nspecific OCS block.  All exploration, development, and production plans are carefully reviewed by \nBOEM (see Section 1.3.3).  Following plan approval, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental \nEnforcement (BSEE) exercises primary oversight of specific permitting and operational activities \n(e.g., drilling and production) on OCS leases. \n1.3.1 National OCS Program Development Process  \nMultiple Section 18 steps are required to prepare a new National OCS Program.  The National \nOCS Program development process begins with the publication of the Request for Information \n(RFI) followed by three analytical stages: (1) the Draft Proposal, resulting from the analysis of all \n26 OCS planning areas and published as part of the Draft Proposed Program (DPP); (2) the  \nSecond Proposal, resulting from the analysis of the Draft Proposal and published as part of the \nProposed Program; and (3) the Final Proposal resulting from the analysis of the Second Proposal \nand published as part of this PFP.  Approval of a new National OCS Program may occur no earlier \nthan 60 days after publication of the PFP.  Figure 1-7 shows the analytical flow process.  This PFP \nincludes the Final Proposal and the third of three analyses resulting in a proposed schedule of \nlease sales for the 2024\u20132029 timeframe.   ",

The analysis contained in the DPP examined and compared all 26 OCS planning \nareas regarding the Section 18(a)(2) factors for consideration, as well as the balancing mandated \nby Section 18(a)(3).  The National OCS Program development process is typically a winnowing \nprocess, and only those program areas and Subarea Options that the Secretary decides are \nappropriate to carry forward for further analysis are included in the next analytical document.  \nThe Second Proposal narrowed the scope of this National OCS Program to the area of the GOM \nnot under withdrawal (i.e., the Western GOM Planning Area, most of the Central GOM Planning \nArea, and a small portion of the Eastern GOM Planning Area); and to the northern portion of the \nCook Inlet Planning Area. \nBOEM has decided to prepare a Programmatic EIS in accordance with the National \nEnvir\nonmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.) and its implementing regulations as \na vehicle for conducting and disclosing the environmental analyses for the National OCS Program.  \nBOEM\u2019s decision to prepare the Programmatic EIS is discretionary because the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia has ruled that the approval of a National OCS Program does \nnot constitute an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources, and that, in the context \nof BOEM\u2019s multiple stage leasing program, the obligation to fully comply with NEPA does not \nmature until the lease sale stage (Center for Biological Diversity v.

Each potential lease sale scheduled in a National OCS \nProgram is subject to separate established pre-lease sale decision processes, including \nenvironmental review and analysis.   \nDuring the lease sale process, the Secretary may further define the area available for leasing.  For \nexample, the Secretary could choose an areawide approach, in which all available unleased \nacreage in a program area is offered for lease, or a targeted leasing approach, which is designed to \nresult in a more focused lease area configuration. \nA targeted approach could, for example, only offer lease sales in areas with high hydrocarbon \nresource potential while appropriately weighing environmental protection.   \nOther potential considerations could include biologically sensitive subareas, and areas of potential \nconflict with other users or uses of the marine environment, such as subsistence hunting and \nfishing activity.  This is consistent with the policy of the OCS Lands Act to make OCS oil and gas \nresources available for development while considering safeguards for the human, marine, and \ncoastal environments.   \nAs shown in Figure 1-9, interested and af fected parties have multiple opportunities to participate \nand comment prior to any decision to hold a specific lease sale.  The lease sale process has \ntraditionally taken about 2 years to complete and contains multiple steps and decision points \nalong the way.   \nFigure 1-9:  OCS Lease Sale Process \n \nWhi\nle a lease sale may not occur until an approved National OCS Program is in place, in some \ncases, lease sales occurring early in a National OCS Program schedule require steps to be taken in \nthe pre-lease sale process prior to final National OCS Program approval.

Call for Information and Nominations (30 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] \n556.301)\u2014In the first step of the lease sale process, BOEM issues a Call for Information \nand Nominations (Call) in the Federal Register on an area proposed for leasing.  \nPotential bidders are invited to submit nominations or indications of interest in specific \nOCS blocks within the Call Area.  The Call also solicits comments about geological \nconditions; archaeological sites; potential multiple uses of the area including navigation, \nrecreation, and fisheries; socioeconomic, biological, and other environmental \ninformation; and asks the public for information on areas of special concern that should \nbe analyzed.   \n2. Area Identification (30 CFR 556.302)\u2014Area Identification (Area ID) is the second major \nstep in BOEM\u2019s oil and gas lease sale process.  During Area ID, BOEM uses information \nand comments received in response to a Call, and in consultation with appropriate \nFederal agencies, develops a recommendation to the Secretary for the area(s) to be \nsubject to further leasing consideration and environmental analyses.  The Area ID \ndecision is announced in the Federal Register. \n3. Review under NEPA\u2014BOEM performs a NEPA review for each lease sale.  This \ntypically includes an EIS that considers the impacts associated with oil and gas activities \nfor a given region or program area.  The NEPA for subsequent lease sales in the same \nregion or program area may rely on that EIS as appropriate, after BOEM confirms \nthrough a DNA or EA that EIS supplementation is not required.  \n4. Government-to-Government Consultations\u2014Under Executive Order (E.O.) 13175 and \nthe Department of the Interior Policy on Consultation with Indian Tribes, BOEM is \nobligated to engage in government-to-government consultations with Tribes on any \nDepartmental action with Tribal implications.  This includes federally recognized Tribes \nwith current and historic interests in coastal areas of Alaska, the Pacific, the GOM, and \nthe Atlantic.  In Alaska, BOEM additionally consults with Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act (ANCSA) Corporations.  These consultations are conducted on \nadditional approvals (e.g., plans and permits) as appropriate throughout the life of an \nOCS oil and gas lease. \n5. Environmental Consultations\u2014Consultations under various environmental statutes \noccur, such as the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531 et seq.) \nand Section 305(b) of the Magnuson--Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801 et seq.).  Pursuant to these environmental statutes, BOEM is \nrequired to consult with agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) \n \n12 Solicitor\u2019s M Opinion 36954, Whether the Department May Issue a Call for Information & Nominations for Outer \nContinental Shelf Lease Sale 91, 93 I.D. 125 (1986). \n",

BOEM also consults, as appropriate, \nunder Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. \u00a7 306108). \n6. Proposed Notice of Sale (NOS) (30 CFR 556.304)\u2014The proposed NOS describes the \ntiming, size, and location of a proposed oil and gas lease sale.  It also provides potential \nbidders with information on proposed economic terms and conditions and any proposed \nmitigation measures (i.e., lease stipulations), which are typically designed to reduce \npotential conflicts with other ocean uses and to protect the environment.  BOEM \npublishes a notice of availability of the proposed NOS in the Federal Register. \n7. Coordination with Governors of Affected States (30 CFR 556.304-307)\u2014Section 19 of \nthe OCS Lands Act (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345) requires BOEM to solicit input on the size, timing, \nand location of lease sales from governors of affected states.  BOEM sends the proposed \nNOS to governors of affected states requesting their recommendations on the proposed \nsize, timing, and location of the lease sale.  The governors have 60 days to submit their \nrecommendations to BOEM.  Prior to holding the lease sale, BOEM sends each governor \nwritten reasons for USDOI\u2019s determination to accept or reject that governor\u2019s \nrecommendation. \n8. Consistency Determination (30 CFR 556.305(b))\u2014All Federal activities affecting the \ncoastal zone, including OCS oil and gas lease sales, must be consistent to the maximum \nextent practicable with the enforceable policies of an affected state\u2019s coastal zone \nmanagement (CZM) program (see 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1456(c)(1) and (2)).  BOEM provides \ncoastal states with a consistency determination on whether the proposed lease sale is \nconsistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the enforceable policies of federally \napproved state Coastal Management Plans.  That is not done, however, for Alaska lease \nsales since the State of Alaska no longer has a federally approved Coastal Management \nPlan.  For more information on BOEM\u2019s CZM work, see https://www.boem.gov/Coastal-\nZone-Management-Act/). \n9. Issuance of a ROD (EIS-level), Finding of No New Significant Impact (FONSI; EA-\nlevel) or DNA\u2014Upon completion of the NEPA review for each individual lease sale, a \ndetermination is made as to the significance, or lack thereof, of potential environmental \nimpacts.  Depending on the type of NEPA review undertaken for a lease sale, the NEPA \nreview process is completed through the issuance of a ROD, a FONSI, or a DNA.   \n10. Final NOS (30 CFR 556.308(a))\u2014BOEM will publish a final NOS at least 30 days before \na lease sale is held.  The final NOS includes information on how to submit bids; the date, \ntime, and location of the bid opening and reading; the OCS blocks being offered; and \nterms and conditions of the lease sale, including lease stipulations. \n11. Holding the Lease Sale (30 CFR 556.516)\u2014BOEM opens the sealed bids at the place, \ndate, and hour specified in the final NOS for the sole purpose of publicly announcing and \nrecording the bids.  BOEM does not accept or reject any bids at that time. ",

Lease Issuance (30 CFR 556.520-522 )\u2014Befor e a lease can be issued, high bids are \nsubject to evaluation regarding the receipt of fair market value (FMV) and analysis \nconfirming that the award of any tract to the highest bidders in the lease sale would not \ncreate or maintain a situation inconsistent with anti-trust laws.  BOEM will issue a lease \nfollowing completion of its FMV analysis and the anti-trust review conducted by the \nDepartment of Justice in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission. \n1.3.3 Exploration and Development  Process  \nAreas with mature oil and gas development, such as the GOM, generally have more recent and \ntherefore more sophisticated seismic data available (e.g., three-dimensional [3-D] seismic \nsurveys) to assess oil and gas resources.  Frontier areas of the OCS generally only have older, less \nsophisticated seismic data (e.g., two-dimensional [2D] seismic surveys) available.  If leasing and \nrelated activities increase in frontier areas, new seismic data will be collected, and more detailed \ninformation will become available.  On the U.S. OCS, seismic data are typically acquired both prior \nto lease issuance (through the issuance of a permit) and after a lease is in effect.   \nAfter BOEM issues a lease, a lessee typically accelerates the process to explore for oil and gas \naccumulations.  In some cases, potential oil and gas resources could already be identified through \nanalysis of existing data and information.  Prior to exploration activities on the lease, an \nexploration plan is submitted to BOEM for environmental review and consideration for approval \n(see Figure 1-10).  \nFigure 1-10:  OCS Exploration Plan and Drilling Review Process  \n \nHigh-res\nolution geophysical surveys on a lease are performed prior to exploration plan submittal \nto identify natural and man-made hazards, areas of potentially sensitive benthic habitat such as \nhard bottom habitat and coral reefs, and significant cultural resources such as historic shipwrecks \nor inundated occupation sites on or below the seabed.  The next phase of exploration involves \ndrilling an exploration well that targets the interpreted oil or gas trap in the subsurface to \ndetermine if an oil or gas resource exists.  If oil or gas is discovered in quantities appearing to be \neconomically favorable, one or more follow-up delineation wells could be drilled to help define the \namount of the resource or the extent of the reservoir.   \nDelineation and production wells are sometimes both termed development wells.  If a lessee \nwishes to drill a development well, a development and production plan must be submitted to \nBOEM so that BOEM can perform environmental review and consider plan approval (see Figure \n1-11).
